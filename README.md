# Brain Tumor Detection using EDCNN

This project implements an Ensemble Deep Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN) for brain tumor classification.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed MRI datasets.
  - : Original dataset files.
  - : Preprocessed data ready for training.
- **models/**: Stores trained model files and checkpoints.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experiments.
- **results/**: Contains results such as plots and evaluation metrics.
  - : Visualization of training/test results.
  - : Performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy).
- **logs/**: Logs generated during training and testing.
- **docs/**: Documentation files.
- **configs/**: Configuration files for model parameters and settings.

## Getting Started

1. Place your MRI dataset in the  directory.
2. Update the configuration file in .
3. Run the training script from the  directory.

## Requirements
