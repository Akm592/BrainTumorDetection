# Brain Tumor Detection

_A deep learning-based approach for automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images._

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for brain tumor detection and classification using deep learning techniques. Brain tumors represent a significant global health concern, and early, accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. Manual analysis of MRI scans is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-observer variability. This automated system aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing rapid and accurate tumor detection.

The system is capable of:

*   Detecting the presence of brain tumors in MRI scans
*   Classifying tumor types (glioma, meningioma, pituitary)
*   Providing high accuracy with minimal computational requirements

## Dataset

The model is trained on a benchmark brain MRI dataset containing both tumorous and non-tumorous samples. The dataset includes:

*   T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI scans
*   Multiple tumor types (glioma, meningioma, pituitary)
*   Multiple views/angles of brain scans

**Note:** If using your own dataset, please ensure it's properly formatted and organized as per the data loading requirements in the usage section.

## Methodology

The approach involves:

### Data Preprocessing:

*   Image resizing to uniform dimensions
*   Normalization of pixel values
*   Skull stripping (removing non-brain tissues)
*   Intensity standardization

### Data Augmentation:

*   Random rotations
*   Horizontal flips
*   Zoom variations
*   Brightness/contrast adjustments

### Model Architecture:

*   Hybrid ensemble deep learning with attention mechanisms
*   Combination of shallow CNN for local details and deep backbone (EfficientNet) for semantic features
*   Attention-based fusion module for intelligent feature integration
*   Classification head optimized for tumor types

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   TensorFlow 2.x
*   Keras
*   OpenCV
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib
*   scikit-learn

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akm592/BrainTumorDetection.git
    cd BrainTumorDetection
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Organize your dataset in the following structure:

```text
data/
├── train/
│   ├── glioma/
│   ├── meningioma/
│   ├── pituitary/
│   └── no_tumor/
└── test/
    ├── glioma/
    ├── meningioma/
    ├── pituitary/
    └── no_tumor/



### Training

To train the model with your dataset:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 100 --batch_size 32
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model on test data:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --test_data /path/to/test/data
```

### Prediction

To make predictions on new MRI scans:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image --model_path /path/to/saved/model
```

## Results

The model achieves high performance in brain tumor detection:

*   **Accuracy:** ~98.5%
*   **Precision:** ~98.6%
*   **Recall:** ~98.5%
*   **F1-Score:** ~98.5%

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for automated brain tumor detection from MRI scans.

## Future Work

Potential improvements and extensions:

*   Multi-modal integration (T2, FLAIR, DWI)
*   Implementation of 3D modeling for volumetric analysis
*   Evaluation on larger, multi-institutional datasets
*   Integration with tumor segmentation
*   Deployment of a web or mobile application interface
*   Exploration of explainable AI techniques for clinical trust

## Limitations

*   The current model is designed for 2D analysis and may not capture full 3D spatial relationships
*   Performance may vary depending on the quality and source of MRI scans
*   While intended as a diagnostic aid, this system should not replace professional medical evaluation
